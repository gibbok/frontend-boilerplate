# frontend-boilerplate

This project is an opinionated boilerplate which helps you build fast, robust, and adaptable single-page application (SPA) in React with Styled Components. It's built on modern tools such as TypeScript, Webpack, Babel, and Travis and contains state-of-art testing and development tools such Cypress, React Test Renderer, StoryBook, and Loki.

Kick-start your project with this boilerplate is super easy and will help you to stay productive.

## üòç Features

Your environment will have everything you need to build and test a modern single-page React application:

- A live-reloading server (HMR) that warns about common mistakes
- Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator
- A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and optimize images and SVG for production, with hashes and sourcemaps
- Autoprefixed CSS, so you don‚Äôt need -webkit- or other prefixes plus a useful CSS normalizer
- Proper linting with ESLint and Prettier
- A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting
- Flowless integration with End to End UI testing and with Continuous integration (CI)
- Visual regression testing
- Support for Component Driven Development (CDD)

## üöÄ Quickstart

1. Clone this repo
1. Run `npm install`
1. Code your project and see it live using `npm start`
1. Work on your React components in isolation with `npm run storybook`
1. Lint and test with `npm run lint` and `npm test`
1. Build for production by running `npm run build`
1. Deploy with a single command to GitHub Pages using `npm run deploy`

## üåü Getting started

### Set up your development environment

1. Make sure you have NodeJS installed in your machine. For detailed instructions, see [Installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/):

2. Clone the project to your computer using:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gibbok/frontend-boilerplate.git
```

3. Navigate to your new folder and run this command to install the project-specific dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

4. Done! You can now start your development server by running `npm start`. This command will start a local server, located at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Creating components

React Components, their tests, and StoryBook stories can be located anywhere in the `src` folder, please use `.tsx` for React with JSX and `.stories.tsx` for stories.

Styled Components are pre-installed by default. Also, your application will use a CSS normalizer, which makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standard.

### Linting

The `npm run lint` lint script supports `.ts, .tsx, .js, .json` files, use `npm run lint:fix` to automatically and safelly formats the code.

If you use Visual Studio Code IDE on file save, your source code will be automatically formatted, but you need to have installed [ESLInt](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension, using:

```shell
code --install-extension dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
```

### Testing

Unit tests are done with Jest. TypeScipts files in the component `src` folder ending with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` will be run through Jest. File for test support as `.support.test.ts` will be excluded from Jest test coverage.

Run tests by executing `npm run test` or simply `npm t`, use `npm run test:watch` to continuously watch your tests when coding.

Visual regression can be run using `npm run test:visual`, when you make changes and you want to save as reference use `test:visual:approve`.

End to End testing using Cypress can be executed locally running `npm run cy:open`, this project automatically perform headless E2E testing on CI using Travis.

Suggested extension [Jest Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner), simply install it by running:

```shell
code --install-extension firsttris.vscode-jest-runner
```

#### Building

Running `npm run build` will compile and build your `src` folder and pipe it to the `build` folder. This folder can then be uploaded to your server.

Running `npm run build-deploy` will compile and build your code and publish on GitHub Pages automatically, your application will be visibleon GitHub, for example at:

```shell
https://gibbok.github.io/frontend-boilerplate/
--------^^ your user ------ ^^ your repository
```

If you want to deploy also StoryBook together with your application on GitHub Pages you can run `npm run build-deploy:all`, this script will place your app in a subfolder `/project` and StoryBook will be situated in folder `/storybook`, for instance:

```shell
https://gibbok.github.io/frontend-boilerplate/project/
https://gibbok.github.io/frontend-boilerplate/storybook/
```

#### Tooling

You can use `npm run clean` to wipe out the cache and start from a fresh slate.

You can see how many source lines of code your project includes by using `npm run sloc`.

You can clean up your project by checking unused npm packages with `npm run dep`.
